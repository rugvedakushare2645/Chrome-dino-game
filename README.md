# Chrome-dino-game

This is a simple clone of the classic Chrome Dino game, built using JavaScript and the HTML5 Canvas API. This project was inspired by the popular endless runner game that appears in the Google Chrome browser when there's no internet connection.

Features
Canvas Rendering: The game utilizes the HTML5 canvas to render the graphics for the dinosaur and cacti.
Animation Loop: Uses requestAnimationFrame to create a smooth game loop.
Player Controls: Control the dinosaur using the Spacebar or Arrow Up key to jump.
Dynamic Obstacles: Randomly generates different types of cacti to challenge the player.
Collision Detection: Implements simple collision detection to determine game over conditions.
Score Tracking: Keeps track of the player's score based on how long they survive.
